### ✦ . > [ 🔮 ] " BYI „ || :: 

× . ∆ :; I am a Dramatic-ish and Moody Person. I can get upset over the smallest things but not to an extent. I can also be easily upset when it comes to spamming or text walls of certain memes. I apologize for that

~ ` || :; I often stay around my friends, mainly [Kiki](link) and [Skittlez](link) . Do not join cuddle piles unless we agreed to do so. 

× . ∆ :; I misspell from time to time because im typing as fast as I can. Adding to this, sometimes I replace 't' with 'z' and 'a' with '∆'. I dont do it as much but it does happen

~ ` || :; I have a mild crowd discomfort, so I hide with friends or go to the very corner of a spot where I can still see my pony. If someone's still covering me, im most likely going to hide them 

× . ∆ :; Im mostly very much annoying if I wanted to interact. I promise im a nice person, just dont be a prick to my friends or other people in general.

~ ` || :; Using tone tags is highly appreciated!! its hard for me to tell if a sentence you made was a joke, a silly comment, or something srs. Here is the reference for [Tone Tags](https://tonetags.carrd.co/)

× . ∆ :; Im always free for c+h when im not with friends, but im usually offtab or waiting.

~ ` || :; My moods switches time to time!! You can tell while we're making this Github LMAO

Will update more about this as It progresses

### # ` . ❌ — DNI || :; 

❌ :; The basic [DNI criteria](https://basic-dni.crd.co/)

❌:; Are you someone I dont wish to interact? Sure! I hide/block freely, so it wouldnt be an issue. Dont want to interact with me? Feel free to ALSO hide/block me unless me or my friends are hosting.

❌:; If you SOMEHOW are in my SCHOOL IRL, DNI DNI DNI. I dont know HOW you got here and WHERE'D you even FIND THIS.

### ✦ . > [ 🎀 ] " IWC/IWEC „ || :: 

🎀 :; Are you a transformers fan? 75% of the time, I find you guys scary, rude, and agressive as hell. If you're one of those people, IWEC or just dont interact with me at all.

🎀 :; You shippers out there, I can see you. If you force ships on people, IWEC to DNI !!

🎀 : If you're supporting drama of any kind in fandims, IWC or don't bring them up to me as often as you can!!

🎀 :; If you think everything is Forsaken lore or similar, IWEC to DNI [^1]

[^1]: Ah yes, Roblox. Specifically games that adapt hackers, admins, and whatnot into their games. IWC if you think that eeevvery ship that ships a character that was adapted in lets say— c00lkidd . c00lkidd is a **minor** in Forsaken, but it doesnt necessarily mean that you ship THAT c00lkidd. For all you know, it could be from TR;UD, Save Robloxia, or the hacker itself.
